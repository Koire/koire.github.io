[Kalua Pork Recipe](https://www.pressurecookingtoday.com/pressure-cooker-kalua-pork/#mv-creation-227-jtr)

## Ingredients

- [ ] pork shoulder (pork butt) roast, cut into two pieces
- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] 1/2 cup water
- [ ] 1 tablespoon liquid smoke
- [ ] Coarse Salt

## Directions

Select Saute to preheat the pot. When hot, add the oil and brown each half of the roast separately. Brown each half of the pork roast on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a platter when browned.

Turn the pressure cooker off, and add water and liquid smoke to the cooking pot. Stir to remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the browned pork and any accumulated juices. Sprinkle the salt over the top of the pork roasts.

Lock the lid in place. Select High Pressure and 90 minutes cook time.

When the timer sounds, use a [natural pressure release](https://www.pressurecookingtoday.com/faq/#NaturalRelease) (approximately 20 minutes). When the valve, drops carefully remove lid.

Remove the meat from the pressure cooker and shred with two forks. (Discard excess fat as you shred). If desired, use a fat separator to remove fat from the juices. Add some of the juices from the pressure cooker to moisten the meat. Place remaining juices in a serving dish to ladle on top of rice, if desired.
