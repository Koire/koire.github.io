[Americas Test Kitchen Beef Wellington](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/13316-beef-wellington)

## Ingredients
 - [ ] 2 or 3 kg roast beef
 - [ ] Dijon mustard
 - [ ] Pie sheet (or make your own)
 - [ ] Lots of cremini mushrooms (2 or 3 normal sized packs, maybe 20 or so total)
 - [ ] Butter
 - [ ] Garlic
 - [ ] Shallots/onions
 - [ ] Heinz Demi-glace sauce (one package)
 - [ ] 生ハム
 - [ ] 1 large egg (plus 1 yolk?)

## Directions

### Beef
 - rub roast with salt and Dijon mustard
### Duxelles
- Mince mushrooms and shallots until very very fine, use a food processor
- Sauté the mushrooms in butter with shallots and butter until they're dried out and sizzling, then add demi glace cook until paste like. Set aside and  allow to cool

### Assembly
- spread out some plastic wrap on the cutting board
- shingle the ham onto the plastic wrap
- spread the duxelles over the ham
- roll ham/duxelles mix around the beef
- wrap the beef tightly (TIGHTLY) with wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes
- roll out the pastry (2 sheets of frozen pastry worked) and cover it with egg wash (egg + 1 yolk)
- wrap it tightly around the beef with seam side up
- gently press the seams together to create a seal and roll it so the seam side is down
- fold the ends like a package and roll them out flat
- wrap the ends under the beef
- refrigerate for at least 15 minutes
### Baking
 - spread egg wash all over the wellington
 - set oven to 230
 - bake for 35 - 40 minutes (or until the crust is golden and meat is 25 degrees) and rotate once
 - remove from oven and allow to rest on a wire rack for about 35-40 minutes

##  Notes

40 minutes was a little long, and the meat ended up being very dry, especially on the tips. I'd try to cook it until the internal temp is 25. After resting the temp was 60, which is basically well done.
