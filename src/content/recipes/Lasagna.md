## Ingredients

- [ ] 4 cups mozzarella cheese shredded and divided
- [ ] ½ cup parmesan cheese shredded and divided
- [ ] ½ pound lean ground beef
- [ ] ½ pound Italian sausage
- [ ] 1 onion diced

- [ ] 36 ounces pasta sauce *see note
- [ ] 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- [ ] 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- [ ] 2 cups ricotta cheese
- [ ] ¼ cup fresh parsley chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large pot of salted water, boil lasagna noodles until al dente according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.
2. In a large skillet or dutch oven, brown beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.
3. Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until thickened.
4. In a separate bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.
5. Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.
6. Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.
7. Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.
